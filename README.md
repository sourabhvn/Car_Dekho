CarDekho Car Price Analysis

This is a simple project where I analyzed used car data from CarDekho. The main aim was to understand how things like the year of the car, fuel type, brand, transmission type, and kilometers driven affect the selling price of second-hand cars.

I used Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to do all the analysis. The dataset had around 8000 rows and included columns like Car Name, Year, Selling Price, KM Driven, Fuel Type, Transmission, and Owner.

From the analysis, I observed that newer cars sell at a higher price. Diesel cars usually have a higher resale value than petrol ones. Manual cars are more common in the market, but automatic cars tend to have slightly better value retention. Maruti and Hyundai were the top brands listed.

This project helped me understand real-world data, how to clean it, how to visualize trends, and draw conclusions that can help buyers or sellers in the used car market.

I also created bar charts, scatter plots, and line plots to explain the trends clearly.
